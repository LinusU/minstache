# minstache

  Mini mustache template engine.

## Installation

    $ npm install minstache
    $ component install visionmedia/minstache

## minstache(1)

  The `minstache(1)` executable can compile a file to a valid 
  stand-alone commonjs module for you, there's no need to have minstache
  as a dependency:

  hello.mustache:

```
Hello {{name}}!
```

  convert it:

```
$ minstache < hello.mustache > hello.js
```

  hello.js:

```js
module.exports = function(obj) {
  function escape(html) {
    return String(html)
      .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
      .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
      .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
      .replace(/>/g, '&gt;');
  };
  return "Hello " + escape(obj.name) + "!"
};
```

## API

### minstache(str, [obj])

  Compile and render the given mustache `str` with optional context `obj`.

### minstache.compile(str)

  Compile the mustache `str` to a stand-alone `Function` accepting a context `obj`.

## Todo

 I just basically needed interpolation for now, but I'll add this stuff later:

  - sections
  - inverted sections
  - lambdas

 I couldn't care less about partials, and will not add them, this lib is meant to
 be a small template engine solution for stand-alone [component](http://github.com/component) templates. If your template takes "partials", pass other rendered strings to it.
